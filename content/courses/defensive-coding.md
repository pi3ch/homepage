## Overview

Numerous critical vulnerabilities in cloud-native apps arise from logical flaws, incorrect assumptions about dependent technologies, and insecure patching. These flaws lack known syntax or patterns detectable by security testing or scanning tools (SAST, DAST, etc.). This complexity makes building secure apps more challenging than ever.

After years of hands-on penetration testing and secure code review, we've developed a unique workshop that covers the full spectrum of handling security vulnerabilities. You will gain expertise in finding, hacking, and fixing security vulnerabilities in modern apps. This hands-on workshop teaches Defensive Programming principles - a set of battle-tested approaches to ensure effective remediation of security vulnerabilities, making your app secure by design

In this three-part workshop, we comprehensively cover everything from Integer Overflow to Prompt Injection. We begin with essential foundational AppSec topics that every beginner must know, progressing to the identification of hard-to-find security vulnerabilities through Black Box, White Box and Fuzzing approaches. Lastly, we take you one step further, to learn how to effectively address security vulnerabilities and avoid common mistakes in security patching.

## Objectives

- Understand the foundational principles of Application Security (AppSec) and their relevance to cloud-native applications.
- Learn to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities using Black Box, White Box, and Fuzzing techniques.
- Gain hands-on experience in detecting logical flaws and misconfigurations in modern app architectures.
- Master Defensive Programming principles to effectively remediate vulnerabilities and build secure applications by design.
- Explore advanced topics such as Integer Overflow, Prompt Injection, and other hard-to-detect vulnerabilities.
- Develop skills to implement secure patching strategies and avoid common pitfalls in vulnerability remediation.
- Enhance your ability to think like an attacker to better defend your applications.
