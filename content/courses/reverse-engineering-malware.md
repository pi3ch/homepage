* Level: Postgraduate
* Delivery: Online
* Location: Canberra, Australia
* Duration: 12 weeks

## Overview

This course is designed to equip students with the foundational skills and knowledge required to analyze and understand malicious software. By delving into the intricacies of reverse engineering, students will gain insights into the methodologies and tools used by cybersecurity professionals to dissect malware and uncover its functionality. The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical concepts and hands-on practice, ensuring that participants develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

Key highlights of the course include:

* An introduction to Intel machine code and assembler language, providing the groundwork for understanding low-level programming.
* Practical training with OllyDbg, a powerful debugging tool, and virtualization techniques to create controlled environments for malware analysis.
* Exploration of the MalDB malware repository, offering access to real-world samples for study and experimentation.
* Familiarization with the Malware Analysis Lexicon, a standardized framework for describing malware characteristics.
* In-depth analysis of ICS/SCADA malware, focusing on threats to industrial control systems and critical infrastructure.

Through a combination of lectures, guided exercises, and independent projects, students will develop proficiency in both static and dynamic reverse engineering techniques. By the end of the course, participants will be well-prepared to tackle complex malware challenges and contribute effectively to cybersecurity operations.

## Objectives

* Equip technical, operational, and management staff at all levels with advanced expertise in malware reverse engineering, enabling them to analyze and mitigate threats effectively.
* Foster a deeper understanding of cyber operations, including the strategies, tools, and techniques employed by various actors in the dynamic and evolving global cyberspace.
* Provide hands-on experience in cyber operations, ensuring participants gain practical skills in a controlled and realistic environment.
