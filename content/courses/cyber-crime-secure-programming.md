## Overview

This course provides a comprehensive exploration of cybercrime and security-enhanced programming techniques. Students will gain a deep understanding of the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and the strategies required to mitigate them. The unit begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of cybersecurity, including threat identification and risk assessment. Students will then delve into the anatomy of cyberattacks, learning how to recognize and respond to organized attacks, viruses, and malware.

Through practical case studies and hands-on exercises, participants will analyze major network vulnerabilities and develop skills to fortify enterprise networks against potential breaches. The course also emphasizes computer forensics, equipping students with the tools and methodologies necessary to investigate and trace cyber incidents effectively on both Linux and Windows platforms.

Additionally, students will study advanced techniques used in mass network attacks and evaluate countermeasures to address these threats. The curriculum covers the mechanisms behind viruses and web-based malware, highlighting common security deficiencies that attackers exploit. In the final segment, learners will explore and utilize specialized tools available for detecting and tracing hacking attempts on Windows and Unix-based systems, preparing them to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges with confidence.
